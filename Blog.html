                I found out that I’m really indecisive, and went back to trends/usage, I might still include some<br>
                photos I’ve taken and edited to give a ‘film look’. I realized that for my project, location and theme<br>
                aren’t really that relevant, so I discarded those data, but kept the dates. I noticed I don't have<br>
                enough photos for a graph so I created a scraper in python, and with the help of internet<br>
                archive’s api, I found their publish date. While this is not 100% accurate for when the photo was<br>
                taken, it gives us a general idea.<br><br>
                I Also learnt about TimelineJS in class so I moved the history section over to that.

                This week, I began organizing the photos I’ve downloaded, sorting them by date, location, and<br>
                theme to streamline the analysis process. For the final submission, I’ll be using GIMP to annotate<br>
                each photo, highlighting key details and techniques relevant to the cultural and historical impact<br>
                of film photography.<br>
                The progress report will be converted into a blog on the final submission.<br>

                This week, I decided to change part of the project by dropping the sections on interactive<br>
                elements and Trends/Usage, and changing over to Image Manipulation. For this aspect, I plan on<br>
                shooting photos using a DSLR camera and editing them in Darktable, a RAW image editor. My<br>
                goal is to give these photos the “film look” that Gen Z gravitates towards, balancing a vintage<br>
                aesthetic with digital convenience. Additionally, I completed and organized my notes on the<br>
                historical overview of film photography, which will be integrated into the website as a main<br>
                section.

                This week, I delved into researching the history of film photography to build a foundational section<br>
                on my website. This involved reading articles, accessing historical archives, and taking notes on<br>
                the timeline and evolution of film photography, from its origins to its modern resurgence. I also<br>
                started gathering digital archives of film photos as visual references, aiming to find images that<br>
                span different eras of film photography to illustrate historical trends on the site.

                In the first week, I focused on laying out the initial structure and layout of the website. I created<br>
                basic headings for each major section and added placeholder text to start visualizing the flow of<br>
                information. The website is developed in HTML for straightforward editing, and I considered ways<br>
                to style the elements with CSS later on for a polished look. This layout serves as the foundation,<br>
                guiding how I will organize the historical, technical, and aesthetic aspects of film photography<br>
                moving forward.
