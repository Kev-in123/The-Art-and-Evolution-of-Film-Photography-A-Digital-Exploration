          <h2>
            Convenience
          </h2>
          With the introduction of digital cameras, photography became significantaly more convenient.<br>
          A photographer could review a photo immediately after taking it, rather than finishing an entire photo shoot, mailing the film rolls to a lab, and waiting for the developed films to be shipped back<br>
          in addition, one could change the ISO on the fly, rather to sticking to a single ISO for the duration of a shoot<br>

          <h2>
            Film Scanning
          </h2>
          Many analog/film shooters may choose to digitize their film photos.<br>
          Most shops will have large flatbed scanners to do this, however, many photographers may want to scan their films themselves, but these flatbedscanners are expensive.<br>
